review: Everything works really well! I really like how you used the switch statement it makes your code look so much cleaner and more organized compared to mine. Adding the alert was also a clever touch, it’s a simple but effective way to enhance functionality. Overall, you did an excellent job, and it’s clear you know what you're doin. Great work!
